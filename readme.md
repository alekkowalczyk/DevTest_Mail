This test took only a couple of hours, so it lacks some important stuff like:

-code comments

-some technical documentation

-proper error handling

-unit tests and mock objects for them

-bold unread messages rows on datagrid

-displaying attachments

-displaying embedded images in html body

-some UI design refining

-saving locally last used credentials and connection settings

-etc....
