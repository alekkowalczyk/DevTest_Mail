As written in the earlier message with the instructions attached, it should take only a couple of hours, so I didn't have done some important stuff like:
-code comments
-some technical documentation
-proper error handling
-unit tests and mock objects for them
-bold unread messages rows on datagrid
-displaying attachments
-displaying embedded images in html body
-some UI design refining
-saving locally last used credentials and connection settings
-etc....
